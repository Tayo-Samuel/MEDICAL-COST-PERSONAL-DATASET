# MEDICAL-COST-PERSONAL-DATASET

Project Overview:
Dive into the world of medical cost analysis with this comprehensive project. Leveraging Python's powerful data science libraries, including pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn, I uncover hidden trends and correlations within the medical cost personal dataset.

Dataset:
Explore a rich dataset containing:

- Age
- Sex
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Number of children
- Smoker status
- Region
- Medical costs

Analysis and Findings:
Discover key insights through:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing with pandas
- Interactive visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Correlation analysis to identify relationships
- Regression analysis to predict medical costs
- Feature engineering and selection for optimal modeling

Tools and Technologies:
- pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- scikit-learn for machine learning and regression analysis.
